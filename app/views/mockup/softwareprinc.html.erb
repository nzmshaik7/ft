<P>
Futuretech is implemented
using an Agile Development Framework (ADF).  The ADF accelerates
the development of the software efficient 
by "maximizing the work that doesn't have to be done."
Membership Auto is a dynamic company with a need to quickly adapt
to changing needs and new discoveries.  The ADF keeps the interfaces
between different components clean and well-defined, allowing for
rapid advances.
</P>

<P><B><font color="#006040" size="+1">SECURITY</font></B></P>

<P>
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used for all Internet transactions,
keeping all of Membership Auto data safe from theft during transit.
The SSL encryption is the same encryption trusted by the banking
system to protect data in transit.
</P>

<P>
Systems that are most vulnerable to hackers, such as Microsoft servers
and PHP, are not used by Futuretech.  This greatly reduces the risk of 
attacks from offshore hackers.  The framework that supports
Futuretech automatically defends against common attacks such as 
SQL injection and cross-site request forgery.
</P>

<P>
Credit card information is not kept on the web servers.  A seperate
and isolated secure server handles all credit card processing, and
is not accessible from the Internet.
</P>

<P><B><font color="#006040" size="+1">ROBUSTNESS</font></B></P>

<P>
Futuretech performs self-checks at various processing steps and at significant
changes to the database.  It verifies that the system state does not
go out of established bounds.  All exceptions to the self-checks
are immediately reported to the software staff for analysis.
</P>

<P>
Futuretech has first-fault error detection built in, so that in the
event that a problem occurs, post-mortem information is available
to figure out the root cause on the first occurrence of the problem.
</P>

<P>
The hosting system is one of the most trusted hosting companies
in the world, and provides geographically separated locations, so
that even in the event of a major disaster, business can continue.
</P>


<P><B><font color="#006040" size="+1">SCALABILITY</font></B></P>

<P>
Futuretech is scalable in two dimensions.  First, the modular design
allows components to be easily divided into separate servers,
simply bringing more compute power to the table.  The hosting company
provides an elastic computing services, so that additional servers
can be added as the demand increases.
</P>

<P>
Second, servers are virtual servers and can be easily increased to
larger servers as demand requires it.
</P>

<P>
All servers are continuously monitored for load, so that new servers
can be provisioned when a server is nearing its capacity.
