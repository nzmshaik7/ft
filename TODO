X Add totals (from qty) to SLI parts table
X "F5" shortcut to add Service Line Item Description dropdown menu.
The "edit" and "add part" on a service line item still drop you down into 
    the basement interface.  I haven't gone the ground floor part for that yet.
X Make the existing service line items look better, more like the form to 
    create one.
